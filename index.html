      <h2>What are Games?</h2>
      <p>A game is a structured type of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an
        educational tool.[1] Many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports
        or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or
        some video games).

        Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played
        alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players,
        such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may
        constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children
        playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player. A toy and a game are not the same.
        Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games present rules for the player to follow.

        Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction. Games generally involve mental or physical
        stimulation, and often both. Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise
        perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role.

        Attested as early as 2600 BC,[2][3] games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures.
        The Royal Game of Ur, Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known games.[4]</p>

      <h2>First video game</h2>
      <p>In October 1958, Physicist William Higinbotham created what is thought to be the first video game. It was a
        very simple tennis game, similar to the classic 1970s video game Pong, and it was quite a hit at a Brookhaven
        National Laboratory open house Higinbotham was born on October 25, 1910 in Bridgeport, CT and grew up in
        Caledonia, NY.
